# Minor Project

## Overview
This project analyzes and processes data from the `50_Startups.csv` dataset. The primary goal is to explore, visualize, and derive insights from the dataset using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Features
- Data loading and exploration
- Basic data visualization
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Potential for further analysis and model building

## Requirements
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `50_Startups.csv`. Ensure the dataset is located in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code accordingly.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "minor project.ipynb"
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Potential Extensions
- Further data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms
- Detailed visualization and reporting
